Breakpoints

Breakpoints (control points) are conditions under which additional design options appear on your page. Breakpoint values contain the following set of properties:

*   Type, breakpoint type with max-width before the specified value and min-width after the specified value.
    
*   Value, breakpoint values in pixels.
    

The breakpoints specified in the theme are applied to all pages. To add a breakpoint to the theme, click on the “+” icon next to the category.
